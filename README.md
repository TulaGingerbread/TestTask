Test Task

Grails version 2.5.4
Groovy version 2.4.4

I did not fully implement sending mail because of problems with my Grails installation (it doesn't show me plugins).
Also I think that features like that should only be correctly implemented on working apps, not test, when you got special email for that and your "customers" have correct emails too.

Everything else works like said in googledoc. I didn't map domains to any specific DB, let Grails use its own. I hope that would be enough.

Test CSV I used is in the root dir.
